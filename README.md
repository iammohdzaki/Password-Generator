How To Use

Create a Builder :
```
 //All Filters are optional
 PasswordGenerator.Builder(PasswordType.RANDOM) // Password Generation Type
            .showLogs(true) // Shows Logs Inside the Library (FOR TEST CASES)
            .includeUpperCaseChars(true) // Include Upper Case in password
            .includeNumbers(true) // Include Numbers in password
            .includeLowerCaseChars(true) // Include Lower Case in password
            .includeSpecialSymbols(true) // Include Special Symbols in password
            .passwordLength(12) // Length of the password (ONLY WORKS IN RANDOM TYPE)
            .callback(object : PasswordGenerator.Callback {
                override fun onPasswordGenerated(response: Response) {
          
                   //Response provides two object 
                   // password : String = "",
                   // strengthResult: StrengthResult
                 
                }
            })
            .build()
            .generate()
```

Strength Result :
```
crackTimeDisplay : 9 years
passwordRating : (0 Weak,1 Fair,2 Good,3 Strong ,4 Very strong) : 4/4
feedback : [Add another word or two. Uncommon words are better.]
crackTimeInSecS :  3.0001E8

```

Types of Password Generation : 
```
PasswordType.RANDOM  // Eg : 1D8dm7j%1hN*&NL@eU/14!XeX
PasswordType.MEMORABLE // Eg : s#0rtW@v369&=  (shortwave)
PasswordType.DASHED / /Eg : ?0Ad-J*!U
```

Additional Feature :
If you only want to check strength of your password, then use :
```
GeneratorHelper.checkPasswordStrength(password, showLogs) // For Test Case
GeneratorHelper.checkPasswordStrength(password) // For Normal UselÌ¥
```
