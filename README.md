		}
	}
```

	}
```

For Maven : 
1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file
```
<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```

	    <artifactId>Password-Generator</artifactId>
	    <version>Latest Version</version>
	</dependency>
```

How To Use

Create a Builder :
```
 //All Filters are optional
 PasswordGenerator.Builder(PasswordType.RANDOM) // Password Generation Type
            .showLogs(true) // Shows Logs Inside the Library (FOR TEST CASES)
            .includeUpperCaseChars(true) // Include Upper Case in password
            .includeNumbers(true) // Include Numbers in password
            .includeLowerCaseChars(true) // Include Lower Case in password
            .includeSpecialSymbols(true) // Include Special Symbols in password
            .passwordLength(12) // Length of the password (ONLY WORKS IN RANDOM TYPE)
	    .customPassword("")//If you want to create custom password from your string (ONLY WORKS WITH PASSWORD TYPE :CUSTOM)
            .callback(object : PasswordGenerator.Callback {
                override fun onPasswordGenerated(response: Response) {
          
                   //Response provides two object 
                   // password : String = "",
                   // strengthResult: StrengthResult
                 
                }
            })
            .build()
            .generate()
```

Strength Result :
```
crackTimeDisplay : 9 years
passwordRating : (0 Weak,1 Fair,2 Good,3 Strong ,4 Very strong) : 4/4
feedback : [Add another word or two. Uncommon words are better.]
crackTimeInSecS :  3.0001E8

```

Types of Password Generation : 
```
(THESE EXAMPLES ARE GENERATED WITH ALL FILTERS ENABLED)
PasswordType.RANDOM  // Eg : 1D8dm7j%1hN*&NL@eU/14!XeX
PasswordType.MEMORABLE // Eg : s#0rtW@v369&=  (shortwave)
PasswordType.DASHED / /Eg : ?0Ad-J*!U
PasswordType.CUSTOM //Eg: Provided String = "MohammadZaki" , Generated Password : " m*#@mm@dz@k!%76"
```

Additional Feature :
If you only want to check strength of your password, then use :
```
GeneratorHelper.checkPasswordStrength(password, showLogs) // For Test Case
GeneratorHelper.checkPasswordStrength(password) // For Normal UselÌ¥
```

How To Use CLI Application (Check Branch -> master-cli):
```
Usage: Password Generator CLI :: 0.1
Subcommands:
    include - Include Filters( upper lower digits special )

Options:
    --version, -version [false] -> Shows Version
    --passwordType, -type [RANDOM] -> Password Type { Value should be one of [random, memorable, dashed, custom] }
    --passwordLength, -length [8] -> Set Password Length { Int }
    --logs, -showLogs [false] -> Logs
    --custom, -custom [GENERATION] -> Custom Password { String }
    --help, -h -> Usage info
```

Example : 
```
//Inside bin folder open cmd to execute commands
> PasswordGenerator -type random -length 12 -showLogs include upper lower

Result :
PASSWORD TYPE -> RANDOM
GENERATING RANDOM PASSWORD
GENERATED PASSWORD -> YFfHhPMvSZTf
STRENGTH CHECK -> YFfHhPMvSZTf
TIME TO CRACK DISPLAY: 3 years
STRENGTH RATING (0 Weak,1 Fair,2 Good,3 Strong ,4 Very strong) : 4/4
VERBAL_FEEDBACK : []
GUESSED NEEDED : 12.000000000000433
CRACK IN SECONDS : 1.000000000001E8
